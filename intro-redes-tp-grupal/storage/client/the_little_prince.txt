Sure, here are some of the best quotes from "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry:

"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."
"All grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it."
"People have forgotten this truth," the fox said. "But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose."
"What makes the desert beautiful,' said the little prince, 'is that somewhere it hides a well..."
"It is such a mysterious place, the land of tears."
"Grown-ups love figures... When you tell them you've made a new friend they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies? " Instead they demand "How old is he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make? " Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him."
"You see, one loves the sunset when one is so sad."
"But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise."
"It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."
"Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies."
